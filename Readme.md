# File Compression

This project implements a file compression tool using **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)**, **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)**, and **Huffman Encoding** algorithms. The goal is to efficiently compress data, reducing file size while preserving essential information for decompression.

## About
The File Compression project combines three powerful compression techniques—DCT, RLE, and Huffman Encoding—to achieve efficient data compression. This tool is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates how these algorithms can be implemented to compress various types of data.

## Features
- **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT):** Transforms data into the frequency domain to enable lossy compression, commonly used in image and audio compression.
- **Run-Length Encoding (RLE):** Compresses sequences of repeated data, ideal for data with consecutive identical values.
- **Huffman Encoding:** Provides lossless compression by assigning variable-length codes to data based on frequency, optimizing storage for frequently occurring elements.
- Supports compression and decompression of files.
- Modular codebase for easy experimentation and extension.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kakorot0Goku0/File-Compression.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd File-Compression
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   # Example for Python
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Note: Update this step based on the specific programming language and dependencies used.*

## Usage
1. **Compress a file**:
   ```bash
   # Example command
   python compress.py input_file output_compressed_file
   ```
2. **Decompress a file**:
   ```bash
   # Example command
   python decompress.py compressed_file output_decompressed_file
   ```
   *Note: Replace `python` with the appropriate command for your implementation language (e.g., `./compress` for C++).*

3. Check the documentation or help for specific command-line arguments:
   ```bash
   python compress.py --help
   ```

## Algorithms
- **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT):** Converts data into a sum of cosine functions, reducing redundancy in the frequency domain. Commonly used in JPEG compression.
- **Run-Length Encoding (RLE):** Replaces sequences of identical values with a single value and count, effective for data with repetitive patterns.
- **Huffman Encoding:** Assigns shorter binary codes to more frequent data symbols, ensuring optimal lossless compression.

### Instructions for Use
1. **Save the File:** Copy the above content into a file named `README.md` in the root directory of your `Kakorot0Goku0/File-Compression` repository.
2. **Customize as Needed:**
   - **Language and Dependencies:** Replace the placeholder commands (e.g., `python compress.py`) with the actual commands for your project. If you share the programming language or specific dependencies, I can update the commands.
   - **File Structure:** If your repository has specific folders (e.g., `src/`, `tests/`), consider adding a "Project Structure" section to describe them.
   - **Examples:** Add sample input/output files or screenshots in the `Usage` section to showcase functionality.
   - **License:** Ensure a `LICENSE` file exists in the repository with the MIT License (or your chosen license). If none exists, I can provide a sample MIT License file.
3. **Commit to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Add README.md"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Additional Notes
- If your project uses a specific programming language (e.g., Python, C++, Java), let me know, and I can tailor the installation and usage sections.
- If you have specific input/output file formats (e.g., images for DCT, text for RLE), I can add details about supported formats.
- If you want to include badges (e.g., for build status, license, or language), I can suggest some standard GitHub badges.

Let me know if you need further refinements or additional sections!
